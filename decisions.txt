In architecture,
we have one class with fields classCode and value.
everytime we call a method fetchNextNumber, pass a unique code in parameter.

the record will be permanently stored in db.

In test data loader, I have passed 10 as a default first value. we can change that or can make a different api to set or update that if needed.

I have used exception handling as well.

for multi threading (delay 5 seconds),given a logic using in controller, config and service in comments. 

Demo util is used to check object if object is valid then only it will return success.
